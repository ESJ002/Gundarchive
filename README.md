## Idea / Planning

As a model kit maker, you are always bound to have a backlog of unbuilt kits to keep track of. Currently I do this in two albums on my phone, one for built and one for unbuilt:
<br>
<img src="/public/readme-images/albums.PNG">
<img src="/public/readme-images/built.PNG">
<img src="/public/readme-images/tobuild.PNG">
<br>
It was then my goal to create a space where I can keep track of kits I'm currently yet to built, and kits I've completed. Thus the Gundam Archive, 'Gundarchive' was born.
